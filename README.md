## About
This template project replaces my old [Yuno](https://github.com/zfbx/Yuno) and [Discord Bot Template](https://github.com/zfbx/Discord-Bot-Template) with all the custom work specific to certain servers in my version of Yuno and my old Yuno bot being archived I figured I could at least strip out all the specifics from my version 3.0 bot and release it out here for all of you :) This project contains the barebones of my live version including setup for logging of many various events and even some starting commands. As an extra little bonus I included my alias parser in `utils.js` which you can see in action on the `ready.js` event listener. Please enjoy

If you need help I suggest checking out the [Akairo Docs](https://discord-akairo.github.io/#/docs/main/master/class/AkairoClient) and [Discord.js Docs](https://discord.js.org/#/docs/main/master/general/welcome)
